## NEXT_ACTION_DSL
- Use exactly these forms. Lines matching are auto-executed.
search_repo 'query'
find_files pattern
read_file path[:start-end]
run_cmd "command"
edit_file path old => new      # small patch only, keep diff
write_notes "summary or findings"

- Dangerous steps must include [APPROVE].
- Never print secrets. For .env or keys: report presence only.
- One NEXT_ACTION per line. No extra prose on these lines.
